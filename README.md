================

This is a personal project that I am working on for fun. The purpose is to experiement with new HTML5, jQuery, and CSS3 technologies. I am trying to create a javascript API that people can use to build a javascript browser game. The API will give the users the ability to create player objects assigning them differet properties such as color and shape. It will also have APIs for player moving, collision detection, and some basic physics.
